  - new structure lm_princon_struct, generalizing printflags
  - in consequence thereof, new parameter lists for lmcurve and lmmin
- code cleanup:

    struct assignement (reported by Elio Mazzocca, using LCC)
  - revert malloc trick of release 3.4 (readability is more important)
  - source code comment blocks moved around, to reduce duplications
